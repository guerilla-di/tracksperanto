=== 2.1.1 / 2011-02-14

* Fix handling of Shake scripts containing stabilizer nodes with no animation
* Remove underscores from tracker names exported to Syntheyes to prevent spaces from being generated

=== 2.1.0 / 2011-02-08
* Adds PFMatchit import support. Also all PFTrack imported cameras will have a camera name injected into the tracker

  usage on huge files.

=== 1.9.8 / 2010-08-11

* Very minor changes and improvements
* The app will now tell you when you try to feed it an empty file
* Change Synetheyes exports to start with a standard frame and not a keyframe to make 1-frame trackers work
* Adds a flip middleware to mirror a tracked comp

=== 1.9.6 / 2010-06-17

* Support Tracker nodes in Shake scripts that come from an old (ages old!) Shake version
* Only parse channels that are actually relevant in the Flame importer

=== 1.9.5 / 2010-05-17

=== 1.9.4 / 2010-04-16

* Fix the boujou exporter to not crash boujou 5

=== 1.9.3 / 2010-04-15

* Fix a crasher when the progress bar was being set higher than 100 percent

=== 1.9.1 / 2010-03-21

* Fix a Pipeline bug introduced with the last version

=== 1.9.0 / 2010-03-21

* Use proper progress bars
* Allow proper chaining of middlewares in the commandline app - you can now apply many middlewares of the same nature in chain, and they will be ordered correctly

* Fix PFTrack imports neglecting the feature name if it only contained digits

=== 1.8.3 / 2010-03-04

=== 1.8.2 / 2010-03-04

* Fix the bug in the Flame exporter that was convincing Flame that there is only one tracker in the setup

=== 1.8.1 / 2010-02-18

* Add Flame stabilizer export support

=== 1.7.5 / 2010-02-17

* Use a special IO so that we can display progress when parsing/reading a file (based on the IO offset)

=== 1.7.4 / 2010-02-02

* Introduce an intentional gap in the reference exports to test trackers with gaps
* Export Syntheyes paths as normal frames, not as keyframes. This produces better solves by not overconstraining the solver
	(Without this TransitionFrms, a crucial parameter in SY, seizes to work)
* Add a LengthCutoff middleware that allows you to remove trackers that have less than X keyframes in them from the export

=== 1.7.3 / 2010-02-02

* Fixed the --only option in the commandline binary

=== 1.7.2 / 2010-01-31

* Add a Lerp middleware that linearly interpolates missing keyframes (USE CAREFULLY!)
* Prevent the Shake lexer from walking into the woods on files that are certainly wrong
* Export proper project length with Nuke scripts
* Ensure preamble for Nuke exports does not get overriden in width/height

=== 1.7.1 / 2010-01-24

* Fix Ruby 1.9 compatibility

=== 1.7.0 / 2010-01-24

* Fix edge cases of specific comp sizes outputting incorrect exports for Equalizer 3 and MatchMover

=== 1.6.9 / 2010-01-20

* Make the commandline progress reports shorter

=== 1.6.8 / 2010-01-13

* Fix frame gap handling for repeating gaps in the Nuke importer

=== 1.6.6 / 2009-12-07

* Handle Hermite cuves in Shake scripts

=== 1.6.5 / 2009-11-27

* Fixes the Shake importer so that it doesn't apply correlation curves if they are not present or constantized to 1

=== 1.6.2 / 2009-11-15

* Fixes the Reformat middleware to not suppress the end_export call. Crucial for exporters that
  use end_export to finalize output
  
=== 1.6.0 / 2009-11-15

* MatchMover has top-left coordinates - fixed for both import and export
* Prevent Tracker from being Array#flatten'ed

=== 1.5.7 / 2009-11-08
