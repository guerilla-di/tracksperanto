=== 2.11.3

* Hint that we only support specific nodes in Nuke
* Hint the user that a comp must be focused in AfterEffects when the import script is run without focusing on a comp first

=== 2.11.1

=== 2.9.3

* Add export for AE null layers as a .jsx script

=== 2.9.2

=== 2.9.1

* Adds an export module for Maya locators on an image plane

=== 2.9

* Tracker objects now use a Hash as internal storage model instead of being an Array delegate.
  Note that due to that some stuff might have become broken since behavior differs in subtle ways.

* Make test runs architecture-resilient by hardcoding floats
* Adds Tracker#to_ruby for people who like that sort of thing

=== 2.8.6

* Ensure the Flame cornerpin export module always exports points in the proper Z-order

=== 2.8.5

* Fix the bug that MatchMover importer would always assume the sequence starting on frame 1
* Fix the bug that Lint tool would raise when the export was started from negative frame offsets

=== 2.8.0

* Add a special exporter for Flame cornerpins. Apparently the bilinear staiblizer wants the trackers to have the right names
  right from the start (top_left, top_right and so on)
* Check trackers sent through to ensure that they always come sequentially without violating the frame ordering

=== 2.7.0

* Speedup Shake script parsing by using a buffering reader

=== 2.6.4

* Use various external dependencies that we extracted
* Note that Nuke now supports import and export of camera tracker features!

=== 2.6.3

=== 2.6.2

* Fix missing progress percentages in the Flame import module

=== 2.6.1

* Fix errors that occurred when empty disabled trackers were present in Flame setups 
* Give better error reports when an unknown constant gets requested (like a wrong importer)
* Use the flame_channel_parser gem now that it's stable.

=== 2.6.0

* Adds the --trim option to remove keyframes that come in negative frames (before frame 0).
  Some apps improperly handle such frames (Syntheyes)

=== 2.5.0

* No status display in the progress bar. It was an annoyance.
* There are still crashes with flexmocks in tests, relevant flexmock issues filed upstream
* Fix Ruby 1.9 compatibility (but the situation will get better since it's now the primary version)
* Use update_hints gem for version checks
* PFTrack 2011 and PFMAtchit actually use the same format, so we don't need to have 2 modules for them

=== 2.4.0

* Added an official PFTrack 2011 exporter that is verified

=== 2.3.3

* Fixed parsing of stereoscopic PFTrack exports

=== 2.3.2

* Fixed handling of inline comments which are tacked onto the line in in Shake scripts

=== 2.3.1

=== 2.3.0

* Fixed issue#1 (Last tracker in some Flame exports receives an empty shift channel)
* Nicer progress reports
* Modified the Accumulator to support nested iterations and random access

=== 2.2.4

* Properly deal with negative frames happening in Shake scripts sometimes. We will now recognize a script starting at negative
frames and "bump" it's frames in curves so that everything neatly starts at frame 0. Granted this does not give us the same frame range
but most apps wil go bonkers anyway if we send them negative frame numbers.

=== 2.2.3

* Prevent zero-length trackers (trackers having no position information) from being accumulated during import.
This had adverse effects on export modules that could not export trackers containing no information. As a sidenote we
will write down in the doco that an export module should not expect empty trackers with no keyframes to be sent

=== 2.2.2

* The last change to PFMatchit exporter had adverse effects on pftrack files, now fixed.
* Pipeline now has it's own exceptions, all inheriting from RuntimeError

=== 2.2.1

* April fool!
* PFMAtchit requires LF in it's files instead of CRLF, but our FPTrack exporter used CRLF. Now fixed.
* Changed PFMatchit exporter to export .txt files instead of .2dt

=== 2.2.0

* Improve documentation substantially
* Changed the Import::Base interface yo use enumeration instead of @receiver.
Upside: This allows us to convert importers to an array of trackers and other niceties.
Downside: stream_parse will be deprecated. It is however still available for backwards compatibility
  
=== 2.1.1

* Fix handling of Shake scripts containing stabilizer nodes with no animation
* Remove underscores from tracker names exported to Syntheyes to prevent spaces from being generated

=== 2.1.0
* Adds PFMatchit import support. Also all PFTrack imported cameras will have a camera name injected into the tracker
* Adds a PFMatchit exporter (PFMatchit only wants cameras with numbers in the name)

=== 2.0.2
* Compatible with Ruby 1.9.2
* Scaler tool now supports negative scaling factors

=== 2.0.0
* Bugfix for PFTrack exports to contain cross-platform linebreaks (rn instead of n)

=== 1.9.9

* Buffer the parsed trackers on disk or in a stream (all backwards-compatible). Substantially reduces conversion times and memory
  usage on huge files.

=== 1.9.8

* Very minor changes and improvements
* The app will now tell you when you try to feed it an empty file
* Change Synetheyes exports to start with a standard frame and not a keyframe to make 1-frame trackers work
* Adds a flip tool to mirror a tracked comp

=== 1.9.6

* Support Tracker nodes in Shake scripts that come from an old (ages old!) Shake version
* Only parse channels that are actually relevant in the Flame importer

=== 1.9.5

* More stringently check for trackers in the Shake script importer (helps from recognizing arbitrary variables as trackers)
* Increase the size of the in-mem string export buffer

=== 1.9.4

* Fix the boujou exporter to not crash boujou 5

=== 1.9.3

* Add direct export to boujou feature tracks

=== 1.9.1

* Fix a Pipeline bug introduced with the last version

=== 1.9.0

* Use proper progress bars
* Allow proper chaining of tools in the commandline app - you can now apply many tools of the same nature in chain, and they will be ordered correctly
* Small rewrites to Pipeline::Base (changes API slightly - please consult the docs)

=== 1.8.4

* Fix PFTrack imports neglecting the feature name if it only contained digits

=== 1.8.3

* Fix faulty remaining trackers report being sent from the pipeline

=== 1.8.2

* Fix the bug in the Flame exporter that was convincing Flame that there is only one tracker in the setup
* Buffer temporary outputs to String buffers until they reach a certain size. Helps with tempfile pollution and IO speed

=== 1.8.1

* Add Flame stabilizer export support

=== 1.7.5

* Use a special IO so that we can display progress when parsing/reading a file (based on the IO offset)

=== 1.7.4

* Introduce an intentional gap in the reference exports to test trackers with gaps
* Export Syntheyes paths as normal frames, not as keyframes. This produces better solves by not overconstraining the solver
	(Without this TransitionFrms, a crucial parameter in SY, seizes to work)
* Add a LengthCutoff tool that allows you to remove trackers that have less than X keyframes in them from the export

=== 1.7.3

* Fixed the --only option in the commandline binary

=== 1.7.2

* Add a Lerp tool that linearly interpolates missing keyframes (USE CAREFULLY!)

=== 1.6.5

* Adds the --only option for the tracksperanto binary to only export a specific format
* Automatically unlink tempfiles in the Equalizer4 exporter

=== 1.6.4

* Adds Boujou 2d feature import support (to export for Boujou use the Shake text format)

=== 1.6.3

* Fixes the Shake importer so that it doesn't apply correlation curves if they are not present or constantized to 1

=== 1.6.2

* Fixes the Reformat tool to not suppress the end_export call. Crucial for exporters that
  use end_export to finalize output
  
=== 1.6.0

* MatchMover has top-left coordinates - fixed for both import and export
* Prevent Tracker from being Array#flatten'ed

=== 1.5.7

* Add a Prefix tool that prefixes tracker names

=== 1.5.6

* Rerelase of 1.5.5 without the huge binary blob in the middle
* Interpret Shake NSplines as Linear instead of discarding them

=== 1.5.4

* Fix a bug in the Shake importer for tracks that have no animation

=== 1.5.37

* Rewrite the Shake parser, support MatchMove and Stabilize nodes and many tracks per node
* Officially add and test the Reformat tool
* Remove the Close tool and close IOs automatically at pipeline end

=== 1.0.0

* Welcome
